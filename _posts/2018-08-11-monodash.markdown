post_description: We, the past interns (including myself) concepted for the next year’s internship application. We decided on an application process that would be about speed. We didn’t want students to sit on their computers for days chipping away at a form of questions, we didn’t want the “right” answer, we wanted their honest and gut reaction. This made it easy for MONO to weed out people trying to give answers that they thought we wanted to hear.
